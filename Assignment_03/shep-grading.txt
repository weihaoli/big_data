Final grade for assignment C: 92%

With the grading deadline just a week after the final class and four days after submission I didn't get to do as much testing on AWS as I would like (run times were quite long and I wanted students to at least have roughly equal cuts even with the runtime variability).

What impressed me across all your assignments is the clarity of your code and clear reasoning behind your logic. Very well done!

Nice one-page write-up for assignment C. Thanks!
